A simple JavaScript game.
## About

Train of Thought was designed by Lumosity’s scientists, engineers and artists to challenge divided attention. Divided attention refers to the ability to simultaneously respond to multiple tasks or task demands, and the game asks players to direct an increasingly fast stream of trains to their corresponding stations.

We used JavaScript to re-make this game from scratch.


## How to play

Your task is to guide an increasing number of trains to their stations. You must divide your attention to guide them all simultaneously.

**Attention is a limited resource that can track only so much information at once — so you must use your attention efficiently by planning ahead.**
